In this project, I created a simple portfolio to display the projects that I have done throughout the University of Arizona Bootcamp. For this project, I used mainly Bootstrap to develop the container, rows, and columns. Our assignment was to use the CSS framework to quickly style and develop a web application.

I found working with Bootstrap to be beneficial because it cut down on the time to make media queries. I spent less time working on floats and more time on adding my own personal touches to the portfolio. I wanted to make something that showed more than just my portfolio but also focused on my unique and creative style. So I took the time to capture my brand, my personality, and creative style.
