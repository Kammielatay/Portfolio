                            I am originally form Modesto, CA. I moved down to San Diego on Janurary 1st of 2015. I was hoping to get into San Diego State University. I thought my chances of getting in would be better if I became local. Fast forward two years and you have four transfer students who began together, finish together. The end goal for me was to later get my master's in Anthropology to eventually teach at a higher-education level. But life has a funny way of changing the plan.

                            While I was trying to figure out what I would do next, I decided to have a little fun. Do some things that I have been afraid to do. Hindsite, I think I would jump out of the plane again instead of run a half-marathon. But then that would make me a liar because I signed up for two more half-marathons the day after completing the first.

                            Bring in the start of 2020, and I decided it was time to move again. This time, I would be making my way over to Peoria, Arizona. What an eye-opening yet wonderful experience it has been thus far.

                            With the increase of usage of social media, I found myself scrolling Pinterest one day. I ran across a pin that said "How to become a software developer." Little did I know that clicking that pin would change the trajectory of my life. It fueled a passion I didn't even know I had.

                            I have spent the last 10 months learning all that I could about web development. I thought the only logical step for myself would be to enroll in a coding bootcamp to push myself out of my comfort zone. Not only am I excited about my future, but I am excited to continue to lean and develop the foundation needed to become a full-stack web developer.
